WISP driver/interface for the ADXL346 accelerometer module
==========================================================

Abstracts all the device-specific details and sets up an interface between the [WISP](http://sensor.cs.washington.edu/WISP.html) and the ADXL346 accelerometer, exposing the accelerometer data through a simple public-facing API.

Currently this project is in prototyping stage, targeting the MSP430G2553 (the processor on-board the LaunchPad).
